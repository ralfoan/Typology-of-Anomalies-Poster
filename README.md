This repository offers a downloadable [infographic](https://github.com/ralfoan/Typology-of-Anomalies-Poster/blob/main/Typology.of.Outliers.and.Other.Anomalies.in.Data.20231007.pdf) that presents a full overview of anomaly types that can be encountered in datasets. Detecting anomalies can help with increasing the quality of your data, or for identifying risks, errors, opportunities, et cetera. The typology describes <em> 3 broad groups of anomalies</em>, <em> 9 basic types</em>, and <em> 63 concrete subtypes</em>. 

For a full explanation of all groups, types and subtypes, download the free open access journal article: Foorthuis, R.M. (2021).
