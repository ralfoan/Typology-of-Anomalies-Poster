# Typology-of-Anomalies-Poster
This repository offers a downloadable poster that presents a full overview of anomaly types that can be encountered in datasets. Detecting anomalies can help with increasing the quality of your data, or for identifying risks, errors, opportunities, et cetera. The typology describes three broad groups of anomalies, 9 basic types, and 63 concrete subtypes. 

For a full explanation of all groups, types and subtypes, download the free open access publication: Foorthuis, R.M. (2021). On the Nature and Types of Anomalies: A Review of Deviations in Data. International Journal of Data Science and Analytics, Vol. 12, No. 4.
